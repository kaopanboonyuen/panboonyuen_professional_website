abstract: Hey everyone! I’m Teerapong Panboonyuen, but you can call me Kao. I’m passionate about developing AI that makes a meaningful impact on the world. Currently, I’m a Senior AI Research Scientist at MARS (Motor AI Recognition Solution) and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Chulalongkorn University, where I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering with a focus on AI methodologies. In my research, I delve into advanced architectures like LLMs and Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to optimize model performance. I’m particularly fascinated by their applications in remote sensing and geospatial analysis, where we can apply mathematical techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets. My work often involves employing statistical models and optimization algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability. I also enjoy teaching machine learning, guiding students through concepts like gradient descent, regularization techniques, and the intricacies of deep learning frameworks. My mission is to push the boundaries of AI, harnessing its power to tackle real-world challenges through rigorous mathematical foundations and innovative problem-solving. Together, let’s create technology that not only advances our understanding but also drives positive change in our communities!

Alright, let’s break the ice! Beyond the research papers and tech jargon, here’s the real scoop about me:

I’m a tech enthusiast with a serious passion for using technology to make the world a better place. When I’m not buried in code or geeking out over the latest tech, you might find me lacing up my running shoes or gearing up for a triathlon. Yep, marathons and triathlons are my thing—they keep me fit and remind me that anything’s possible with a little grit and a lot of sweat.

I’m a lifelong learner at heart. Whether it’s catching the latest tech trends, diving into new research, or just chatting with fellow nerds, I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing in technology.

But it’s not all work and no play. I love giving back to the community and am always up for volunteering at events that spark my interest. Connecting with people and making a difference is what keeps me motivated.

In my daily life, I love sharing insights and experiences, so feel free to follow my journey at [My WordPress Blog](https://kaopanboonyuen.wordpress.com/).

So, if you want to swap stories about the newest gadgets, discuss the latest research, or just chat about anything under the sun, hit me up at [panboonyuen.kao@gmail.com](mailto:panboonyuen.kao@gmail.com)!

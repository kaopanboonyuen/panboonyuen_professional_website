summary: Hey everyone! I’m Teerapong Panboonyuen, but you can call me Kao. I’m passionate about creating impactful AI. While working on my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Chula, I’ve taught, tackled exciting data science projects, and assisted in machine learning classes. My goal? To elevate AI and leverage it for a better world. My journey has been a thrilling exploration of advanced technologies, from diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to self-supervised learning and probabilistic modeling.
abstract: Hey everyone! I’m Teerapong Panboonyuen, but you can call me Kao. I’m passionate about building AI that drives meaningful impact. Currently, I’m a Senior AI Research Scientist at MARS (Motor AI Recognition Solution) and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Chulalongkorn University, where I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, specializing in advanced AI methodologies. My research focuses on pushing the boundaries of AI through transformer architectures, diffusion models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs), with a strong foundation in optimization theory, latent spaces, and stochastic processes. I’m especially drawn to applications in remote sensing and geospatial analysis, where I leverage deep learning techniques like CNNs and RNNs to uncover patterns in complex data. Beyond research, I love teaching machine learning and mentoring students on concepts like gradient descent, regularization, and the inner workings of deep learning frameworks. My mission is to blend rigorous mathematical principles with innovative problem-solving to create AI that tackles real-world challenges. Whether it’s exploring the potential of attention mechanisms in LLMs or enhancing predictive models with statistical optimization, I’m constantly seeking to expand what’s possible in AI. Let’s collaborate to build technology that inspires, solves problems, and makes a lasting difference!

Alright, let’s break the ice! Beyond the research papers and tech jargon, here’s the real scoop about me:

I’m a tech enthusiast with a serious passion for using technology to make the world a better place. When I’m not buried in code or geeking out over the latest tech, you might find me lacing up my running shoes or gearing up for a triathlon. Yep, marathons and triathlons are my thing—they keep me fit and remind me that anything’s possible with a little grit and a lot of sweat.

I’m a lifelong learner at heart. Whether it’s catching the latest tech trends, diving into new research, or just chatting with fellow nerds, I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing in technology.

But it’s not all work and no play. I love giving back to the community and am always up for volunteering at events that spark my interest. Connecting with people and making a difference is what keeps me motivated.

In my daily life, I love sharing insights and experiences, so feel free to follow my journey at [My WordPress Blog](https://kaopanboonyuen.wordpress.com/).

So, if you want to swap stories about the newest gadgets, discuss the latest research, or just chat about anything under the sun, hit me up at [panboonyuen.kao@gmail.com](mailto:panboonyuen.kao@gmail.com)!

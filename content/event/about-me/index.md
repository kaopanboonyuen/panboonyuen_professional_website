summary: Let’s meet Kao, a Senior Research Scientist at MARSAIL and a C2F High-Potential Postdoc at Chulalongkorn University. Since earning his Ph.D. in 2020, he’s been pushing the limits of AI—using transformers to unlock new insights from satellite images and geospatial data. By combining deep learning with smart optimization, Kao tackles some of the toughest challenges in remote sensing. Beyond his research, he’s passionate about inspiring and mentoring the next generation of AI innovators.

abstract: Hello! I’m Teerapong “Kao” Panboonyuen, and I specialize in creating cutting‑edge AI architectures that combine rigorous theory with transformative applications. I currently work as a Senior Research Scientist at MARSAIL and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Chulalongkorn University, with a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering focused on advanced AI methods. My research centers on Vision Transformers and self‑attention mechanisms, generative adversarial networks (GANs), latent space modeling, and stochastic processes — with a strong grounding in optimization theory. I’m particularly passionate about applications in remote sensing and geospatial analytics, where capturing long‑range dependencies and global spatial context (rather than just local or sequential) is crucial. In my teaching and mentoring, I emphasize the newer tools, transformer architectures, attention heads, positional encoding, as well as optimization methods that support scalability and robustness. I weave in lessons on model inductive biases, latency/accuracy trade‑offs, and efficiency—because success at scale demands more than just accuracy. My mission is to combine mathematical rigor with creative problem solving to architect AI solutions that don’t just work in the lab — they perform, generalize, and endure in real settings. Whether pushing attention mechanisms in Vision Transformers, refining generative models, or optimizing predictive systems for environmental and remote‑sensing challenges, I'm always focused on creating AI that moves the needle. Let’s build something that matters.

### A quick glimpse at the person behind my work

This profile photo represents more than just a face—it reflects the passion, curiosity, and dedication I bring to everything I do. Whether I’m writing code, mentoring students, or diving into cutting-edge AI research, I approach it all with the same drive and focus. From lecture halls at Chula to stages at international conferences, my goal is to help shape technology that’s smarter, more human, and genuinely impactful.

> Big thanks to modern AI for sharpening up these visuals—helping them reflect the professional tone that best represents who I am.

This is my official profile photo—the one I use across everything from academic credentials to my AI research profile. It represents the face I share with the world as I continue to grow in both academic and professional spheres.

But here’s another side of me—outside the labs and research. This candid travel photo is completely untouched by AI. No filters, no edits—just me exploring new places and enjoying life. Whether I’m wandering hidden streets in Japan or taking in the quiet beauty of nature, these moments remind me of the balance between ambition and reflection.

P.S. Here’s a fun little AI-generated art toy version of me—I was just curious to see what I’d look like as a cartoon character.

### Beyond the Research

So, who am I beyond the algorithms and equations?

I’m a tech enthusiast who believes in the power of innovation to make the world a better place. When I’m not deep into neural networks, you’ll likely find me on the track, in the pool, or out cycling—training for my next IRONMAN triathlon. Endurance sports like running, marathons, and triathlons keep me grounded. For me, they’re a reminder that with grit, discipline, and perseverance, anything is possible.

I’m also a lifelong learner—always curious about the latest trends in AI, technology, and science. But learning doesn’t stop at theory. I’m passionate about sharing knowledge, volunteering, and engaging with communities that foster growth and inspiration.

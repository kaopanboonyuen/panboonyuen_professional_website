My journey has been a thrilling exploration of advanced technologies, from diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to self-supervised learning and probabilistic modeling.
abstract: Hi guys! I’m Teerapong Panboonyuen, but you can call me Kao. I’m passionate about building AI that drives meaningful impact. Currently, I’m a Senior AI Research Scientist at MARSAIL (Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Chulalongkorn University, where I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, specializing in advanced AI methodologies. My research focuses on pushing the boundaries of AI through transformer architectures, diffusion models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs), with a strong foundation in optimization theory, latent spaces, and stochastic processes. I’m especially drawn to applications in remote sensing and geospatial analysis, where I leverage deep learning techniques like CNNs and RNNs to uncover patterns in complex data. Beyond research, I love teaching machine learning and mentoring students on concepts like gradient descent, regularization, and the inner workings of deep learning frameworks. My mission is to blend rigorous mathematical principles with innovative problem-solving to create AI that tackles real-world challenges. Whether it’s exploring the potential of attention mechanisms in LLMs or enhancing predictive models with statistical optimization, I’m constantly seeking to expand what’s possible in AI. Let’s collaborate to build technology that inspires, solves problems, and makes a lasting difference!

### A quick glimpse at the person behind my work

This profile photo represents more than just a face—it reflects the passion, curiosity, and dedication I bring to everything I do. Whether I’m writing code, mentoring students, or diving into cutting-edge AI research, I approach it all with the same drive and focus. From lecture halls at Chula to stages at international conferences, my goal is to help shape technology that’s smarter, more human, and genuinely impactful.

> Big thanks to modern AI for sharpening up these visuals—helping them reflect the professional tone that best represents who I am.

This is my official profile photo—the one I use across everything from academic credentials to my AI research profile. It represents the face I share with the world as I continue to grow in both academic and professional spheres.

But here’s another side of me—outside the labs and research. This candid travel photo is completely untouched by AI. No filters, no edits—just me exploring new places and enjoying life. Whether I’m wandering hidden streets in Japan or taking in the quiet beauty of nature, these moments remind me of the balance between ambition and reflection.

P.S. Here’s a fun little AI-generated art toy version of me—I was just curious to see what I’d look like as a cartoon character.

### Beyond the Research

So, who am I beyond the algorithms and equations?

I’m a tech enthusiast who believes in the power of innovation to make the world a better place. When I’m not deep into neural networks, you’ll likely find me on the track, in the pool, or out cycling—training for my next IRONMAN triathlon. Endurance sports like running, marathons, and triathlons keep me grounded. For me, they’re a reminder that with grit, discipline, and perseverance, anything is possible.

I’m also a lifelong learner—always curious about the latest trends in AI, technology, and science. But learning doesn’t stop at theory. I’m passionate about sharing knowledge, volunteering, and engaging with communities that foster growth and inspiration.

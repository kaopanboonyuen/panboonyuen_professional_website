My research focuses on **Learning Representations**—developing cutting-edge algorithms with optimization theory to push AI's limits. I work with advanced models like GANs and Diffusion Models, leverage Self-Supervised Learning, explore how Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) could reshape the future of AI.

I am currently a **Senior Research Scientist** at [**MARSAIL (Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)**](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/MARS/) and a <a href="https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/files/scholarship/Website_Announcement_Postdoc_May_2025.pdf" style="color:#FF69B4;" target="_blank">**C2F High-Potential Postdoc**</a> at [**Chulalongkorn University**](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/). I received my [**Ph.D. in Computer Engineering**](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/talk/ph.d.-thesis-defense/) from <a href="https://www.chula.ac.th/en/" style="color:#FF69B4;" target="_blank">**Chulalongkorn University**</a>, where I specialized in AI. On top of that, I’m the founder of <a href="https://myrida.pages.dev/" style="color:#FF69B4; font-weight:600;" target="_blank">**MYRIDA**</a>.

<!-- My passion is focused on **Cognitive Intelligence** to unlock human potential. I am keenly interested in **Remote Sensing**, where LLMs reveals transformative insights and redefines how we perceive and interact with our environment. -->

Passionate about **Cognitive Intelligence** and unlocking human potential, I’m also deeply immersed in **Geospatial Intelligence**, where LLMs uncover groundbreaking insights that reshape how we understand and interact with our world.

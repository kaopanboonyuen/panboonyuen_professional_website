My research focuses on **Learning Representations**—developing cutting-edge algorithms with optimization theory to push AI's limits. I work with advanced models like GANs and Diffusion Models, leverage Self-Supervised Learning, delve into Adversarial Attacks with Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize AI capabilities.

I am currently a **Senior AI Research Scientist** at [**MARS (Motor AI Recognition Solution)**](https://www.marssolution.io/) and a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at [**Chulalongkorn University**](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/). I earned my [**Ph.D. in Computer Engineering**](https://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/en/prospective/graduate/phd-computerengineering/) from  <a href="https://www.chula.ac.th/en/" style="color:#FF69B4;" target="_blank">**Chulalongkorn University**</a>, where I specialized in AI.

My passion is focused on **Cognitive Intelligence** to unlock human potential. I am keenly interested in **Remote Sensing**, where LLMs reveals transformative insights and redefines how we perceive and interact with our environment.

You can find summaries of my academic, industry, and teaching experience in my [**CV**](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/files/panboonyuen_cv.pdf), and explore more about my personal life on my [**blog**](https://kaopanboonyuen.wordpress.com/). Additionally, check out some of my [**music on SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com/kaopanboonyuen).

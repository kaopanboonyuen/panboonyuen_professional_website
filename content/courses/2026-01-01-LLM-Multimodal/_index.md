## 🌍 Why this course exists

The world is entering the **multimodal intelligence era**.

AI can now:
- 👀 see images
- 👂 hear audio
- 🎥 understand video
- 📄 reason over documents
- 🧠 think across modalities

But **power without understanding is dangerous**.

This course exists to:
- rebuild multimodal LLMs from **first principles**
- empower learners to **build, not just use**
- place **ethics and humanity** at the center

---

## 🎯 Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

- Explain **what multimodal LLMs really are**
- Design multimodal pipelines **from scratch**
- Choose between **pretraining, fine-tuning, RAG, and agents**
- Implement basic multimodal models in code
- Evaluate models correctly (not just accuracy)
- Share models responsibly with the global community

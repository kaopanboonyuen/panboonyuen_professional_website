## 🎯 Why This Chapter Matters

Before solving problems, you must understand **why** you are solving them.

LeetCode is not just a website.  
It is a **thinking framework** used worldwide to evaluate engineers.

---

## 🤔 What is LeetCode?

**LeetCode** is an online platform for practicing:

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Logical problem solving
- Interview-style coding questions

Problems range from:
- Beginner (arrays, loops)
- Intermediate (hash maps, trees)
- Advanced (DP, graphs, system thinking)

---

## 🌍 Who Uses LeetCode?

LeetCode-style questions are used by:

- Google
- Meta (Facebook)
- Amazon
- Microsoft
- Apple
- Netflix
- Startups & research labs

Even if the interview is **not on LeetCode**,  
the **problem patterns are the same**.

---

## 🧠 What LeetCode Is REALLY Training

LeetCode is NOT about memorizing code.

It trains you to:
- Break big problems into smaller ones
- Recognize patterns
- Choose the right data structure
- Optimize time & memory
- Explain your reasoning clearly

---

## 🔍 What Interviewers Look For

Interviewers are evaluating **how you think**, not just the final answer.

They care about:

- Clear understanding of the problem
- Logical step-by-step reasoning
- Clean, readable code
- Correct time complexity (Big-O)
- Ability to improve a slow solution

---

## 🧪 Interview Reality Check

You are usually expected to:

1. Explain the problem in your own words
2. Start with a simple (even slow) solution
3. Analyze time complexity
4. Improve it
5. Communicate clearly

Perfect code ≠ Perfect interview  
Clear thinking = Pass

---

## 🧠 Common Beginner Misunderstanding

{{< spoiler text="Does LeetCode measure intelligence?" >}}
❌ No  
✅ It measures **problem-solving patterns**
{{< /spoiler >}}

Someone who practiced patterns will outperform  
someone who is “smart but untrained”.

This is **learnable**, not talent-based.

---

## 🧩 Examples of Patterns You Will Learn

| Pattern | Example |
|------|--------|
| Two pointers | Palindrome check |
| Hash map | Two Sum |
| Sliding window | Subarray problems |
| Prefix sum | Range queries |
| Stack | Valid parentheses |
| BFS / DFS | Tree & graph traversal |

Once you see the pattern,  
many problems feel **similar**.

---

## 🏫 Why LeetCode is Used in Exams

LeetCode-style questions test:

- Logic
- Edge cases
- Complexity awareness
- Coding discipline

These skills apply to:
- Midterm / final exams
- Programming contests
- Research code
- Real-world software

---

## 🏁 How to Use LeetCode Correctly

❌ Wrong way:
- Copy solution
- Memorize code
- Skip explanation

✅ Right way:
- Understand the idea
- Rewrite in your own style
- Analyze complexity
- Explain out loud

If you can **teach it**, you truly understand it.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Course

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Look at a problem
- Identify its pattern
- Choose the right approach
- Write clean, efficient code
- Explain your solution confidently

That is exactly what interviewers want.

---

## 🚀 Final Message

LeetCode is not a test of intelligence.  
It is training for **structured thinking**.

If you practice correctly,  
you will think like a software engineer.

And that skill lasts a lifetime 💡

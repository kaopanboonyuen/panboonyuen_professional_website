## Just finished an epic city run through Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo!

Hey everyone! I just wrapped up an incredible running experience across Japan's vibrant cities—Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. I managed to hit sub-1-hour times while soaking in the unique vibes of each place. It was the perfect mix of pushing my pace and enjoying the sights along the way!

### Chapter 1: Osaka Running

This trip marks my third time in Japan, but this time I started in the Kansai region, kicking things off in Osaka. My main goal? To conquer a city run and aim for a sub-1-hour 10K.

Bright and early, after a good night’s rest, I hit the streets at 4:54 AM. The weather was just right, making the run super enjoyable. I ended up covering 10.59K at a pace of 4:42, finishing in 49 minutes. Here’s the route I took:

Osaka is truly a city that hooks you; it’s filled with hidden gems waiting to be explored. After three action-packed days, it was time to move on to Kyoto!

### Chapter 2: Kyoto Running

Next up was the challenge of a sub-1-hour city run in Kyoto. I only had two days here, and luck wasn’t on my side—rain greeted me in the morning. But nothing was going to stop my determination!

I crushed the city run in Kyoto, finishing 10.78K in 49 minutes (pace 4:38), which was even faster than my Osaka run! I think the rain actually helped; the air felt fresh and invigorating. Here’s my route:

Wrapping up my run in Kyoto felt like a major win—2 out of 3 goals achieved! Before heading to my final destination, I hopped on the Shinkansen back to Tokyo. 

I took my first-ever Shinkansen ride from Kyoto to Tokyo, leaving at 9:39 AM and arriving at 11:54 AM. It was an absolute treat! I opted for the Green Car for that extra comfort and snagged a window seat to soak in the views. Here’s a glimpse of that journey:

### Chapter 3: Tokyo Running

Finally, I’ve made it to Tokyo! There’s always a surprise waiting here. Before my city run, a professor from Todai treated me to a swim at the Olympic pool used during the Tokyo 2020 Games. What an experience! I swam 1.2K in just 28 minutes at a pace of 2:25 per 100m. The Olympic-standard pool was incredible, and swimming alongside serious athletes was an adrenaline rush.

Now, back to the final running mission. On my second day in Tokyo, I kicked off my run at 6:52 AM. The weather was perfect—18°C with a refreshing breeze—ideal for running.

### Summary of My Running Experience

1. **Osaka Running:** Sub1 10.59K City Run, 49:48min, Pace 4:42
2. **Kyoto Running:** Sub1 10.78K City Run, 49:57min, Pace 4:38
3. **Tokyo Running:** Sub1 10.17K City Run, 44:58min, Pace 4:25
4. **Tokyo Swimming:** 1,200m (1.2K), 28:58min, Pace 2:25

This trip to Japan was absolutely fantastic! Even though it was late summer and winter is just around the corner, running through these three major cities expanded my horizons. I encountered amazing insights into Japanese culture, met locals, and explored unseen places. 

I can’t wait for the next experience, hopefully tackling the Tokyo Marathon (42.195K) someday! Fingers crossed!

Until next time, happy running! 🏃‍♂️🇯🇵

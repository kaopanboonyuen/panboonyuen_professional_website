## 42.195K ‚Äì The Bangkok Marathon 2022: Conquering the Full Marathon

---

I did it. I finally ran a Full Marathon‚Äî42.195 kilometers through the streets of Bangkok. It‚Äôs still sinking in, but the feeling is electric. This wasn‚Äôt just another run; it was a milestone, a test of determination, and an experience I‚Äôll never forget.

---
### The Decision to Go the Distance
---

The idea of running a full marathon had been on my mind for a while. It‚Äôs one of those challenges that, once you‚Äôve thought about it, you can‚Äôt shake. I‚Äôd done plenty of 5Ks and 10Ks, even completed a half marathon once, but the full 42.195 KM? That was uncharted territory. So, when I finally decided to register for the Bangkok Marathon, it felt like I was committing to something much bigger than just a race.

From the moment I hit that ‚Äúregister‚Äù button, I knew there was no turning back. The excitement was real. Every time I thought about the race, I‚Äôd get a little rush of adrenaline, knowing that I was about to push my limits like never before.

---
### Training: The Journey Begins
---

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîmy training for this marathon wasn‚Äôt exactly textbook. I hadn‚Äôt trained for the full distance before. My longest run leading up to race day was a half marathon, and that was just once. Most of my runs were 5K or 10K, and while those were good for keeping in shape, they didn‚Äôt fully prepare me for the grueling distance of a full marathon.

But I was determined. Every time I laced up my running shoes, I reminded myself that this wasn‚Äôt just another race. This was the race. My strategy was simple: keep my pace steady, listen to my body, and most importantly, finish strong.

---
### Race Day: The Big Moment
---

Race day arrived with a mix of excitement and nerves. As I stood at the starting line, surrounded by thousands of other runners, I felt the weight of what I was about to do. But more than anything, I felt ready. This was the moment I‚Äôd been waiting for.

I started strong, hitting my Sub1 10K goal in 55 minutes. I felt good, my pace was on point, and I was in the zone. But as the kilometers ticked by, the reality of the distance started to set in. From the 10K mark to 21.1K, I slowed down to a steady pace of around 5. I knew I needed to conserve energy for the long haul.

When I hit the 22K mark, things started to change. My legs were getting heavier, and my pace slowed to the point where I was more walking than running. A senior runner even teased me, saying I‚Äôd planned to run the first half and walk the second, which, in hindsight, wasn‚Äôt too far from the truth. But I kept going, focused on one goal: crossing that finish line.

The infamous ‚ÄòDevil Km.35‚Äô‚Äîa point in the race where many runners hit the wall‚Äîcame and went. Honestly, I was so caught up in the moment that I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd passed it. By then, I was walking and chatting with fellow runners, soaking in the atmosphere of this incredible event. The camaraderie, the support, the shared struggle‚Äîit all made the experience that much more meaningful.

---
### The Final Stretch: A Run to Remember
---

The last 10KM were something special. As I crossed the Rama VIII Bridge just as the sun was rising, I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. The view was breathtaking, and the realization that I was nearing the finish line gave me a final burst of energy.

And then, there it was‚Äîthe Grand Palace, gleaming in the early morning light, marking the end of this incredible journey. Crossing that finish line was one of the most satisfying moments of my life. I‚Äôd done it. I‚Äôd run my first Full Marathon, all 42.195 kilometers of it.

**42.195K ‚Äì The Bangkok Marathon 2022: My Journey to the Finish Line**

---

The moment I crossed the finish line at the Bangkok Marathon 2022, a rush of emotions hit me all at once. It was a mixture of exhaustion, disbelief, and joy, but most of all, pride. I had just run 42.195 kilometers, completing my very first full marathon. To many, it may just be a race, but to me, it was a testament to what sheer willpower can achieve. It was fun, exhilarating, and painful all at once. Every stride brought me closer to the finish, but it also pushed me beyond my limits. My legs screamed for mercy, my heart raced faster than I could catch my breath, but I didn‚Äôt stop. There was no turning back.

The training leading up to the marathon had been a rollercoaster. I remember the doubts I had when I first registered. Could I really do it? I had run a few 5Ks and 10Ks, and I even finished a half marathon, but this was something else entirely. A full 42.195K? That felt impossible at first. Yet, the more I trained, the more I realized that it wasn‚Äôt about being the fastest‚Äîit was about the journey, the perseverance, and the mental toughness to keep going even when everything hurts.

> Completing the Bangkok Marathon 2022 was more than just a physical achievement. It was a personal triumph. It showed me that I am capable of so much more than I give myself credit for. It reminded me that perseverance and determination are the true markers of success. And it gave me a deep sense of gratitude for every person who cheered me on, every runner I met along the way, and every moment that brought me closer to that finish line.

But the journey doesn‚Äôt end here. I‚Äôm not stopping at one marathon. I will keep running, keep pushing myself, and keep striving for greatness. I‚Äôve tasted the sweet victory of crossing the finish line, and I‚Äôm already planning my next challenge. This marathon may be over, but my journey has just begun.

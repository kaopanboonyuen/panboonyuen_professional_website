## ALBERT vs SLICK: The New AI Fashion at MARSAIL

---

In 2025, MARSAIL (Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) is proud to introduce two groundbreaking AI models that are redefining car damage assessment for insurance â€” **ALBERT** and **SLICK**. These models embody a teacher-student relationship: ALBERT, the teacher, delivers uncompromising accuracy, while SLICK, the student, achieves blazing-fast speeds tailored for real-time insurance applications.

---

### ALBERT: The Teacher Model â€” Precision at a Cost

---

ALBERT stands for *Advanced Localization and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers*. This model is designed to be highly accurate and detailed in detecting subtle damages such as small scratches, dents, and cracks on vehicles. It leverages a vision transformer architecture enhanced with localized deformable tokens and parameter sharing to precisely focus on critical damage regions.

However, this precision comes with a computational cost. ALBERT requires powerful CUDA-enabled GPUs and is relatively slow, making it ideal for offline batch processing or scenarios where accuracy takes precedence over speed.

### SLICK: The Student Model â€” Lightning Speed Meets Smart Knowledge

To address real-time insurance needs, MARSAIL developed **SLICK** â€” *Selective Localization and Instance Calibration with Knowledge*. This model distills knowledge from ALBERT and integrates domain-specific insurance metadata like bumper zones and vehicle model weak points. 

SLICK boosts processing speed by over **700%** compared to ALBERT, enabling instant damage assessments on edge devices or mobile apps without sacrificing much accuracy. Its adaptive attention mechanism dynamically calibrates segmentation proposals using contextual knowledge graphs, making it robust under varying light, weather, and occlusion conditions.

### Why This Matters for Car Insurance

---

- **Accuracy vs. Speed:** ALBERT excels in detailed offline analysis, perfect for complex claim investigations. SLICK offers instant, reliable damage detection to accelerate frontline claim approvals and garage estimates.

- **Hardware Flexibility:** ALBERT demands high-end GPUs; SLICK can run efficiently on more modest, real-world devices â€” a game changer for field agents and repair shops.

- **Knowledge Integration:** SLICKâ€™s use of insurance-specific metadata bridges the gap between raw image analysis and domain expertise, improving real-world applicability.

---

## Mathematical Insight (Simplified)

---

ALBERT refines its internal feature embeddings \( z^{(l)} \) at layer \( l \) through multi-scale self-attention (MSA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules with layer normalization (LN):

$$
z^{(l+1)} = z^{(l)} + \text{MSA}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)})) + \text{MLP}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)}))
$$

Meanwhile, SLICK enhances mask quality scores \( s_{mask} \) by combining image features \( f_{img} \) with knowledge graph embeddings \( f_{kg} \) gated by a sigmoid activation \( \sigma \):

$$
s_{mask} = \sigma(W_q [f_{img} \| f_{kg}]) + b
$$

This formula reflects how SLICK intelligently modulates attention using both visual and domain knowledge.

## Looking Ahead

---

MARSAIL continues to innovate by balancing AI model accuracy and deployment efficiency. ALBERT and SLICK represent the cutting edge of automotive AI, ready to transform insurance claim processes in Thailand and beyond â€” enabling smarter, faster, and fairer car insurance.

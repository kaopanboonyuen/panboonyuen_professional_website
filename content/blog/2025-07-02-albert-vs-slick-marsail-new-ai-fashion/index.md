### SLICK: Revolutionizing Car Damage Segmentation with Knowledge-Enhanced AI at MARSAIL

---

The recent Google AI video on Knowledge Distillation: A Good Teacher is Patient and Consistent offers valuable insights into how AI models can be trained efficiently by leveraging a "teacher-student" framework. The key takeaway from this approach is that a well-trained teacher model can pass down its knowledge to a student model, significantly improving performance and generalization. This technique has sparked new ideas for MARSAIL and our work on SLICK (Selective Localization and Instance Calibration for Knowledge-Enhanced Car Damage Segmentation).

{{< twitter user="GoogleAI" id="1937554536966619399" >}}


In the same spirit of knowledge transfer, SLICK takes inspiration from the concept of "distilling" knowledge from large, complex models to create an AI system capable of precise, real-world car damage segmentation. Through components like Selective Part Segmentation, Localization-Aware Attention, and Knowledge Fusion, SLICK enhances the ability of AI models to focus on and accurately segment vehicle parts‚Äîeven under challenging conditions like occlusions and deformations. Much like the patient and consistent teacher-student relationship in knowledge distillation, SLICK learns from vast datasets (including synthetic crash data and real-world insurance records) to ensure robustness and adaptability across a variety of damage scenarios.

At MARSAIL, inspired by Google AI's knowledge distillation, we‚Äôre applying these principles to create an AI system that not only improves segmentation accuracy but also optimizes the entire automotive insurance and repair workflow. With SLICK, we are ready to bring this advanced AI to Thailand, enhancing efficiency, reducing fraud, and setting new standards for the industry.

### ALBERT: The Teacher Model ‚Äî Precision at a Cost

---

ALBERT stands for *Advanced Localization and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers*. This model is designed to be highly accurate and detailed in detecting subtle damages such as small scratches, dents, and cracks on vehicles. It leverages a vision transformer architecture enhanced with localized deformable tokens and parameter sharing to precisely focus on critical damage regions.

However, this precision comes with a computational cost. ALBERT requires powerful CUDA-enabled GPUs and is relatively slow, making it ideal for offline batch processing or scenarios where accuracy takes precedence over speed.

---

### SLICK: The Student Model ‚Äî Lightning Speed Meets Smart Knowledge

---

To address real-time insurance needs, MARSAIL developed **SLICK** ‚Äî *Selective Localization and Instance Calibration with Knowledge*. This model distills knowledge from ALBERT and integrates domain-specific insurance metadata like bumper zones and vehicle model weak points. 

SLICK boosts processing speed by over **700%** compared to ALBERT, enabling instant damage assessments on edge devices or mobile apps without sacrificing much accuracy. Its adaptive attention mechanism dynamically calibrates segmentation proposals using contextual knowledge graphs, making it robust under varying light, weather, and occlusion conditions.

### üöò Teaching machines to see smarter and faster: the MARSAIL teacher-student model

---

In the race to deliver the best car damage detection for insurance claims, MARSAIL takes a cutting-edge approach inspired by how humans learn: through mentorship. Our **teacher-student model** architecture pairs a high-capacity ‚Äúteacher‚Äù network with a lean, speedy ‚Äústudent‚Äù model, capturing the best of both worlds ‚Äî precision and efficiency.

### What is the teacher-student model?

---

Think of the **teacher** as a seasoned expert with a deep understanding of vehicle damage nuances ‚Äî it‚Äôs large, powerful, and painstakingly precise. The **student**, meanwhile, is like an apprentice: smaller, faster, and designed to perform well in real-world settings with limited resources.

The magic happens when the student **learns to mimic** the teacher's insights without needing to replicate its full complexity. This process is known as **knowledge distillation** ‚Äî where the teacher‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft‚Äù predictions guide the student‚Äôs training, helping it grasp subtle visual patterns that would be hard to learn from raw data alone.

### How does the student learn from the teacher?

---

The training process involves the student observing both the teacher‚Äôs output and the ground truth, gradually adjusting itself to replicate the teacher‚Äôs nuanced judgments. This dual supervision accelerates the student‚Äôs learning curve, enabling it to deliver near-teacher accuracy with significantly fewer parameters.

## Mathematical Insight (Simplified)

---

At the heart of our system lies a sophisticated process that refines how the model understands and represents visual data at every step. Imagine ALBERT as a multi-layered brain that carefully adjusts its internal view of an image piece by piece. At each layer, it uses two powerful tools: one that lets it look broadly across different parts of the image to understand overall patterns (multi-scale self-attention), and another that processes these insights through focused, step-by-step reasoning (a multilayer perceptron).

$$
z^{(l+1)} = z^{(l)} + \text{MSA}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)})) + \text{MLP}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)}))
$$

This dynamic combination helps ALBERT balance the big picture with fine details, ensuring that the model not only recognizes individual features but also how they relate to each other in context. To keep this learning smooth and stable, it applies a normalization step‚Äîsimilar to tuning an instrument‚Äîto make sure each layer‚Äôs output remains consistent and meaningful.

Parallel to this, SLICK operates like an intelligent curator, enhancing the model‚Äôs confidence in its predictions. It does this by merging two streams of knowledge: the direct visual cues from the image itself and additional information pulled from a structured knowledge graph‚Äîthink of this as a database of domain-specific facts and relationships.

$$
s_{mask} = \sigma(W_q [f_{img} \| f_{kg}]) + b
$$


To blend these inputs effectively, SLICK employs a gating mechanism that acts like a smart filter or valve. This gate carefully weighs how much influence the visual data and the knowledge graph should each have in shaping the final mask quality scores. By doing so, the model doesn‚Äôt just rely on what it sees but also on what it knows about the world, leading to sharper, more reliable segmentation.

In essence, this combination of refined visual understanding and context-aware knowledge integration lets our system adapt its focus dynamically‚Äîprioritizing regions and details that matter most for accurate damage assessment and claim processing.

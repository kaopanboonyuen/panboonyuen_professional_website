This yearâ€™s **Chombueng Marathon** marked a special milestone for me: my **second-ever full marathon**. My first was the **Bangkok Marathon 2022**, but this time, it felt even more meaningful as I returned to my **hometown, Ratchaburi**, to take on the challenge. Despite being born here, it wasnâ€™t until nowâ€”at the age of 30â€”that I finally had the chance to run this iconic race in my own backyard.

The **Chombueng Marathon**, now in its **38th year**, is one of Thailandâ€™s oldest and most cherished marathons. Itâ€™s not just a race; itâ€™s a tradition that brings together runners from across the country and beyond, while showcasing the unique charm of this small but spirited district.

## The Journey Back Home  

Coming back to Chombueng brought back a flood of childhood memories. Growing up, I spent countless weekends visiting my mom, who worked as a teacher here. The tranquil forests, the famous **Tham Chomphon cave**, the peaceful campus of **Rajabhat University Chombueng**â€”theyâ€™ve all remained beautifully unchanged. Running through these familiar sights made the experience even more special, as if the past and present collided in the best possible way.

## The Race  

The **2025 Chombueng Marathon** was held on **January 19th**, with the gun going off for the **42.195K runners at 3:00 a.m.**. The weather was perfect for running, hovering between **15â€“19Â°C**â€”cool and crisp, just the way I like it.

I started off strong, clocking a **5:39 average pace for the first 5K**, easing slightly to **5:54 for the next 10K**. By the time I reached the halfway point at 21K, I was feeling good, finishing the first half in just over 2 hours. But as the second half began, I shifted gears to a more strategic approach: **run-walk intervals**. I wanted to finish this race injury-free and with enough energy to enjoy the rest of the dayâ€”because lifeâ€™s too short to spend it limping around post-race!

In the end, I crossed the finish line with a **chip time of 5 hours and 36 minutes**. While it wasnâ€™t a personal best or a sub-5, the sense of accomplishment and joy I felt was unbeatable.

## The Magic of Chombueng  

What truly sets the Chombueng Marathon apart is the **atmosphere and community spirit**. The entire town comes alive for this event, cheering runners on from start to finish.

Iâ€™ll always remember the **monks sprinkling holy water** on us as we ran byâ€”a uniquely Thai tradition that made me smile every time. Then there were the **students**, standing by the roadside in the early hours, clapping, cheering, and offering encouragement. And, of course, the **locals** who came out to support us, their smiles and shouts of _"à¸ªà¸¹à¹‰ à¹†!"_ (Keep going!) giving us the boost we needed to push through each kilometer.

To everyone who stood out in the cool morning air to cheer us on: **thank you**. Your energy, enthusiasm, and kindness made all the difference.

## Lessons and Reflections  

This was my second full marathon, and while I didnâ€™t hit my sub-5 goal, Iâ€™m proud of what I achieved. I went into this race with very little trainingâ€”my recent runs had mostly been short 5Ks. But this marathon reignited my passion for running and reminded me why I love this sport so much.

The biggest lesson? Itâ€™s okay to let go of the pressure. Instead of obsessing over times and splits, I focused on enjoying the journey, listening to my body, and soaking in the experience. Running should be fun, and as long as you keep moving forward with a smile, thatâ€™s what matters.

I know there are more full marathons in my future. And when the next one comes around, Iâ€™ll be ready.

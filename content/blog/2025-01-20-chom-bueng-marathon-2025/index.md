This year’s **Chombueng Marathon** marked a special milestone for me: my **second-ever full marathon**. My first was the [**Bangkok Marathon 2022**](http://localhost:1313/blog/2022-11-22-bangkok-marathon-2022conquering-the-full-marathon/), an unforgettable experience that sparked my love for the 42.195K distance. Completing that first marathon taught me the value of resilience and determination, and it’s the reason why I continue to embrace the challenge and joy of running full marathons. 

> This time, it felt even more meaningful as I returned to my **hometown, Ratchaburi**, to take on the challenge. Despite being born here, it wasn’t until now—at the age of 30—that I finally had the chance to run this iconic race in my own backyard. Running in my hometown for the most fun marathon of my life—42.195K finisher at the Chombueng Marathon 2025.

The **Chombueng Marathon**, now in its **38th year**, is one of Thailand’s oldest and most cherished marathons. It’s not just a race; it’s a tradition that brings together runners from across the country and beyond, while showcasing the unique charm of this small but spirited district.

## The Journey Back Home  

---

Coming back to Chombueng brought back a flood of childhood memories. Growing up, I spent countless weekends visiting my mom, who worked as a teacher here. The tranquil forests, the famous **Tham Chomphon cave**, the peaceful campus of **Rajabhat University Chombueng**—they’ve all remained beautifully unchanged. Running through these familiar sights made the experience even more special, as if the past and present collided in the best possible way.

## The Race  

---

The **2025 Chombueng Marathon** was held on **January 19th**, with the gun going off for the **42.195K runners at 3:00 a.m.**. The weather was perfect for running, hovering between **15–19°C**—cool and crisp, just the way I like it.

I started off strong, clocking a **5:39 average pace for the first 5K**, easing slightly to **5:54 for the next 10K**. By the time I reached the halfway point at 21K, I was feeling good, finishing the first half in just over 2 hours. But as the second half began, I shifted gears to a more strategic approach: **run-walk intervals**. I wanted to finish this race injury-free and with enough energy to enjoy the rest of the day—because life’s too short to spend it limping around post-race!

In the end, I crossed the finish line with a **chip time of 5 hours and 36 minutes**. While it wasn’t a personal best or a sub-5, the sense of accomplishment and joy I felt was unbeatable.

## The Magic of Chombueng  

---

What truly sets the Chombueng Marathon apart is the **atmosphere and community spirit**. The entire town comes alive for this event, cheering runners on from start to finish.

I’ll always remember the **monks sprinkling holy water** on us as we ran by—a uniquely Thai tradition that made me smile every time. Then there were the **students**, standing by the roadside in the early hours, clapping, cheering, and offering encouragement. And, of course, the **locals** who came out to support us, their smiles and shouts of _"สู้ ๆ!"_ (Keep going!) giving us the boost we needed to push through each kilometer.

To everyone who stood out in the cool morning air to cheer us on: **thank you**. Your energy, enthusiasm, and kindness made all the difference.

## The Race Atmosphere  

---

This year’s marathon was filled with joy and excitement. I met so many incredible runners, each radiating energy and enthusiasm as we gathered at the start line at 3 a.m. The crowd was electric, with smiles all around and cheers that warmed the cool morning air. The support from the spectators was truly special, and I want to give a big shoutout to two amazing women who became unexpected guides during my race.  

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Dressed in vibrant orange and blue shirts, these two seasoned runners unknowingly set the perfect pace for me during the first 15K. With their steady rhythm, I was able to maintain a comfortable **5:50 min/km pace**, which kept me going without overexerting myself. Though I hadn’t trained much and had no particular strategy in mind, following them gave me the boost I needed to tackle the early stages of the marathon.  

However, reality hit midway—I realized that sustaining that pace for the rest of the race was beyond my current fitness level. Adjusting my strategy, I had to let go of my hopes for a **sub-4 finish**, but I’m incredibly grateful to those two women for helping me start strong.

</div>

In the end, I crossed the finish line in 5 hours and 38 minutes. While it wasn’t the time I dreamed of, it was still a proud moment. Next time, I know **sub-4 isn’t too far out of reach**. Here’s to continuing the journey and pushing myself to new limits!

## Lessons and Reflections  

---

This was my second full marathon, and while I didn’t hit my sub-5 goal, I’m proud of what I achieved. I went into this race with very little training—my recent runs had mostly been short 5Ks. But this marathon reignited my passion for running and reminded me why I love this sport so much.

The biggest lesson? It’s okay to let go of the pressure. Instead of obsessing over times and splits, I focused on enjoying the journey, listening to my body, and soaking in the experience. Running should be fun, and as long as you keep moving forward with a smile, that’s what matters.

I know there are more full marathons in my future. And when the next one comes around, I’ll be ready.

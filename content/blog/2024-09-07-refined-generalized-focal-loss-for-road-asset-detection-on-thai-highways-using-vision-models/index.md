### Introduction and Motivation

We are pleased to announce that our paper, titled *“Enhanced YOLOv8-Based Object Detection of Road Assets Utilizing Generalized Focal Loss: A Case Study on Thai Highway Imagery”*, has been accepted for oral presentation at the 5th International Conference on Highway Engineering (iCHE 2024). This opportunity marks a significant moment in our academic journey, especially after a hiatus from international conferences since completing my Ph.D. I am eager to re-engage with the academic community and share our recent advancements in person.

### Motivation and Relevance

Thailand's highway infrastructure plays a critical role in its economic development and connectivity. However, managing and maintaining these extensive road networks presents numerous challenges, particularly in detecting and assessing road assets. Accurate identification of road features such as signs, barriers, and markings is essential for effective maintenance and safety management.

In this context, our research addresses a pressing need in highway engineering: improving road asset detection on Thai highways. Traditional object detection methods often struggle with the diverse and complex conditions found on roadways, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel approach that leverages an advanced vision model with a refined Generalized Focal Loss.

Our proposed method (Fig. 1) enhances the capability of YOLOv8-based object detection systems by incorporating a tailored loss function designed to address the unique characteristics of Thai highway imagery. By optimizing the detection process, our approach aims to provide more reliable and precise data for road asset management. This advancement not only contributes to the field of highway engineering but also supports the development of more efficient infrastructure management practices in Thailand.

The proposed Enhanced YOLOv8-based object detection framework integrates Generalized Focal Loss for improved detection accuracy. This approach includes various YOLOv8 model variants, ranging from YOLOv8n to YOLOv8x, each offering a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. The network architecture leverages convolutional layers with Batch Normalization and Leaky ReLU activations. The Generalized Focal Loss, designed to address class imbalance, enhances performance for small and difficult-to-detect objects by focusing on hard examples. Our contribution didn’t just stop at the models; we also built our own dataset from scratch. By equipping a vehicle with high-resolution cameras, we captured detailed imagery of road assets across Thai highways. This custom dataset forms the backbone of our approach, providing a strong foundation for model training. The training utilizes the AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters to optimize convergence and model performance. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04388" target="_blank">[Refined Generalized Focal Loss]</a></p> </div>

## Paper Highlights:

Our research addresses a critical issue in road safety: detecting key road assets such as pedestrian bridges, pavilions, signs, and concrete guardrails. We implemented an enhanced YOLOv8 model integrated with **Generalized Focal Loss**, which significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in complex environments with diverse lighting and backgrounds.

### Formula 1: Generalized Focal Loss

We employed **Generalized Focal Loss**, which reduces the contribution of easily classified examples and focuses more on hard examples.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{GFL}} = - \alpha (1 - p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)
$$

Where:
- $( p_t \)$ is the predicted probability for the correct class,
- $\( \alpha \)$ balances the importance of positive/negative examples,
- $\( \gamma \)$ adjusts the model’s focus on hard examples.

This formula highlights our approach to improving object detection, especially for challenging highway assets in varying conditions.

### Key Metrics:
The results demonstrate our model's superior performance:
- **mAP50**: 80.340
- **mAP50-95**: 60.840
- **Precision**: 79.100
- **Recall**: 76.680
- **F1-Score**: 77.870

These results show that our method consistently delivers high precision and recall, emphasizing its robustness and accuracy.

### Formula 2: mAP Calculation

The mean Average Precision (mAP) is used to evaluate detection accuracy. For our model, mAP is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{mAP} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{AP}_i
$$

Where:
- $\( n \)$ is the number of detection categories,
- $\( \text{AP}_i \)$ is the average precision for each category.

### Comparison of YOLOv8 Variants:

| Model    | mAP50 | mAP50-95 | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| YOLOv8n  | 71.100| 47.760   | 80.100    | 63.460 | 70.820   |
| YOLOv8s  | 75.150| 52.070   | 82.660    | 69.950 | 75.780   |
| YOLOv8m  | 79.570| 58.060   | 85.410    | 71.290 | 77.710   |
| YOLOv8l  | 80.270| 59.110   | 82.580    | 77.220 | 79.810   |
| YOLOv8x  | 80.340| 60.840   | 79.100    | 76.680 | 77.870   |

In this comparison, YOLOv8x demonstrates the best mAP50-95 performance, while YOLOv8l leads in F1-Score. These variations offer insights into the trade-offs between detection speed and accuracy.

### What’s Next?

Our paper will undergo a **fast-track formal review process** for potential publication in the **Transportmetrica A journal**. We’re optimistic that this research will significantly contribute to highway engineering and road asset management fields.

## Architecture of LLMs

LLMs are built on advanced architectures that often include transformer models. A transformer model utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. The core components of a transformer are:

- **Encoder**: Processes the input data.
- **Decoder**: Generates the output sequence.

### Transformer Architecture Formula

The key mathematical operation in transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which can be described as follows:

$\[ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \]$

where:
- $\( Q \)$ is the query matrix,
- $\( K \)$ is the key matrix,
- $\( V \)$ is the value matrix,
- $\( d_k \)$ is the dimensionality of the keys.

## Training LLMs

Training LLMs involves several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess large text corpora.
2. **Model Initialization**: Start with a pre-trained model or initialize from scratch.
3. **Training**: Use gradient descent and backpropagation to minimize the loss function.

## Introduction to LLMs for Satellite Images

Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) like SatGPT for satellite imagery involves several critical stages. This process transforms a pre-trained model into a specialized tool capable of analyzing and generating insights from satellite images. This blog post provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning and deploying SatGPT, covering each phase in detail.

**Figure 1: Scenarios and Performance Metrics from Zhang & Wang's Study**

In their paper *‚ÄúGood at Captioning, Bad at Counting: Benchmarking GPT-4V on Earth Observation Data‚Äù* ([arXiv:2401.17600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17600)), Zhang and Wang (2024) present a detailed analysis of how GPT-4V performs across various tasks. Figure 1 highlights key scenarios and the model‚Äôs performance:

1. **Location Recognition**  
   **Scenario:** Guess the name of the landmark based on features like its dome and layout.  
   **Example Answer:** With its distinctive style and layout, the landmark is identified as the Nebraska State Capitol.

2. **Image Captioning**  
   **Scenario:** Provide a one-sentence caption for the given image.  
   **Example Caption:** An aerial view of an airport terminal, featuring nearby aircraft, taxiways, and parking areas.

3. **Land Use & Land Cover Classification**  
   **Scenario:** Classify the image into one of several categories.  
   **Example Classification:** The best description for the image is a Shipping Yard.

4. **Object Localization**  
   **Scenario:** Identify the coordinates of the described object in the image.  
   **Example Description:** The gray windmill in the center.  
   **Coordinates:** [233, 383, 376, 542]

5. **Object Counting**  
   **Scenario:** Estimate the number of trees visible in the image.  
   **Count:** 134

6. **Change Detection**  
   **Scenario:** Count buildings in various damage categories and present in JSON format.  
   **JSON Format:**  
   ```json
   {
     "count_before": 75,
     "no_damage": 2,
     "minor_damage": 73,
     "major_damage": 0,
     "destroyed": 1
   }
   ```

**Performance Metrics:**

- **RefCLIP Score:** Shows how well the model performs on reference-based tasks.
- **F1 Score:** Reflects the model‚Äôs accuracy in classification tasks.
- **Mean IoU:** Measures the model‚Äôs performance in object localization.

## Overview of the Fine-Tuning Process

The process of fine-tuning and deploying a satellite-specific LLM model involves the following stages:

1. **Data Preparation**
2. **Model Selection**
3. **Fine-Tuning Paradigm**
4. **Model Validation and Evaluation**
5. **Export and Deployment to Hugging Face**

## Step-by-Step Fine-Tuning of SatGPT for Satellite Imagery

### 1. Data Preparation

**Objective**: Collect, preprocess, and format satellite images and associated textual annotations.

**Steps**:

1. **Collect Satellite Images**: Obtain satellite images from sources such as commercial providers or public datasets (e.g., Sentinel, Landsat).

2. **Annotate Images**: Label images with relevant information (e.g., land cover types, objects of interest).

3. **Preprocess Images**: Resize and normalize images to match the input requirements of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

4. **Prepare Textual Descriptions**: Generate textual descriptions or annotations for each image, which will be used for training the text generation component.

**Example**:

```python
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize feature extractor and tokenizer
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Sample image and text
image = ... # Load satellite image
text = "This is a description of the satellite image."

# Prepare inputs
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
labels = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
```

### 2. Model Selection

**Objective**: Choose an appropriate pre-trained model as the foundation for SatGPT.

**Options**:

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: For processing and extracting features from satellite images.
- **GPT-2 or GPT-3**: For generating textual descriptions or insights based on image features.

**Example**:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, ViTModel

# Load pre-trained models
image_model = ViTModel.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')
text_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
```

### 3. Fine-Tuning Paradigm

**Objective**: Adapt the selected models to work together for the specific task of analyzing satellite imagery.

**Steps**:

1. **Combine Models**: Integrate ViT for image feature extraction and GPT for text generation.

2. **Define Loss Functions**: Use suitable loss functions for image and text components.

3. **Training Loop**: Implement a training loop to update model parameters based on the image-text pairs.

**Example**:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=image_model,  # This would be a combined model in practice
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,  # Prepare your dataset
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

### 4. Model Validation and Evaluation

**Objective**: Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model to ensure it meets the desired criteria.

**Steps**:

1. **Validation Set**: Use a separate dataset to validate the model‚Äôs performance during training.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or BLEU score (for text generation).

**Example**:

```python
# Evaluate the model
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
print(eval_results)
```

### 5. Export and Deployment to Hugging Face

**Objective**: Make the fine-tuned model available for inference and integration through Hugging Face.

**Steps**:

1. **Export the Model**: Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer.

2. **Upload to Hugging Face**: Use the `transformers` library to push the model to the Hugging Face Hub.

3. **Create an Inference Endpoint**: Deploy the model and set up an API endpoint for user interactions.

**Example**:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load model from Hugging Face Hub
nlp = pipeline("text-generation", model="username/satgpt-model")

# Use the model
result = nlp("Describe the land cover of this satellite image.")
print(result)
```

## Additional Concepts

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines document retrieval with generative models to improve response accuracy.
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: Adapt transformers for image processing by treating images as sequences of patches.

### Formula for Self-Attention in RAG

In RAG, the attention mechanism can be described as:

$\[ \text{RAG}(Q, K, V, D) = \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) + \text{Retrieval}(D) \]$

where $\( D \)$ represents retrieved documents.

### Vision Transformer (ViT)

The Vision Transformer treats images as sequences of patches and processes them with transformer architectures. The key operation in ViT involves:

$\[ \text{Patch Embedding}(I) = \text{Linear}(I) + \text{Positional Encoding} \]$

where $\( I \)$ is the image and the output is a sequence of patch embeddings.

## Full Flow Diagram

Here's a conceptual flow of how data is processed through SatGPT, from input to output:

1. **Input**: Satellite Image + Textual Description
2. **Image Processing**: ViT processes image into feature vectors.
3. **Text Generation**: GPT-2 generates textual descriptions from image features.
4. **Output**: Generated Text

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning and deploying a satellite-specific LLM like SatGPT involves several critical stages: data preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, validation, and deployment. By following these steps, you can create a powerful tool for analyzing satellite imagery and generating valuable insights.

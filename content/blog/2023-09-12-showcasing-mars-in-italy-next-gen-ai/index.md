## Presenting MARS: Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes at ICIAP 2023

---

In **September 2023**, I had the privilege of presenting my latest AI research, **MARS** (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes), at the **International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2023)**, held in **Udine, Italy**, from **September 11‚Äì15**. MARS is a specialized deep learning model developed for **car damage instance segmentation**, a vital application in the automotive insurance and garage service sectors.

{{< twitter user="kaopanboonyuen" id="1822723598764876000" >}}

Our model leverages **Self-Attention Mechanisms** combined with **Sequential Quadtree Nodes**, which together enable MARS to achieve significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines such as Mask R-CNN (ICCV 2017), PointRend (CVPR 2020), and Mask Transfiner (CVPR 2022). These improvements were validated across multiple benchmark datasets, including a large Thai car-damage dataset.

> MARS was accepted at ICIAP 2023 with a competitive **acceptance rate of 0.64**, and our work is published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. This international recognition affirms the impact and novelty of our approach.

## Why MARS Matters: From Thailand to Italy, Building the Future of Automotive AI

---

The journey of **MARS** began not in a conference hall in Europe but in the bustling cities and garages of **Thailand**, where the real-world challenges of the automotive industry sparked a vision. Every day, countless car owners and insurance agents face delays, inconsistencies, and even disputes when assessing vehicle damage. Manual inspections often rely on human judgment ‚Äî which can be slow, subjective, or prone to error. In garages, mechanics struggle with non-standardized repair cost estimates. Insurers grapple with fraudulent claims, inflated repairs, and time-consuming paperwork. These challenges aren‚Äôt unique to Thailand ‚Äî they‚Äôre global. But we decided to start solving them at home.

> At **MARSAIL** ‚Äî the *Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory* ‚Äî we asked ourselves: *Can we create a deep learning system that sees, understands, and evaluates vehicle damage better than a human?* Could we develop an AI model smart enough to assist insurers, fast enough for real-time applications, and precise enough to help garage operators deliver fair, standardized repairs?

We believe the answer is yes ‚Äî and our vision for this transformation is detailed in our MARSAIL blog:
üëâ [**MARSAIL: The Smart Engine Behind the Future of Car Insurance and Intelligent Garages**](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/blog/2025-07-01-marsail-the-smart-engine-behind-the-future-of-car-insurance/)

The answer was **MARS** ‚Äî *Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes* ‚Äî our flagship AI architecture built from the ground up for **car damage instance segmentation**. Unlike traditional models like Mask R-CNN or PointRend, which were designed for general-purpose segmentation tasks, MARS is laser-focused. It leverages **quadtree spatial hierarchies**, **self-attention refinement**, and a custom transformer-based backbone to identify scratches, dents, cracks, and broken parts ‚Äî even in complex lighting, occlusion, or varied car surface conditions.

> What sets MARS apart is its *precision*. It doesn‚Äôt just draw rough outlines ‚Äî it *understands* the contours of the damage. Whether it‚Äôs a shallow scratch on a bumper or a crumpled fender after a collision, MARS detects it with clarity, outperforming state-of-the-art models with a significant margin in our Thai car damage benchmarks. And this isn‚Äôt just academic ‚Äî this is AI *for the real world*, trained with real damage cases, tuned for high-stakes applications like insurance claims and repair verification.

So when **ICIAP 2023** announced their international conference in **Udine, Italy**, we knew it was time to take our Thai-born innovation global. From Bangkok to Udine, we carried not just a poster and a paper ‚Äî but a vision. A vision that **AI can transform the automotive industry**, not by replacing people, but by empowering them: giving insurers confidence, garages clarity, and drivers trust in the system.

Presenting MARS in Italy wasn‚Äôt just a research milestone ‚Äî it was a symbol of what‚Äôs possible when bold ideas are met with rigorous engineering and a passion for solving real-world problems. Our work was selected for publication in the **Lecture Notes in Computer Science** by **Springer**, a recognition that underscores the technical excellence and practical value of our research.

At **MARSAIL**, our mission continues. We are building an end-to-end ecosystem of automotive AI: from car damage detection to **automated cost estimation**, from **OCR document parsing** to **insurance fraud detection**, all powered by AI models trained with diverse Thai datasets and built to serve global standards.

Because in the future we see, **a single smartphone photo** is enough to initiate a car claim, verify vehicle condition, and provide a fair quote ‚Äî all in seconds. This is the **Digital Insurance Twin** we‚Äôre crafting. And we believe it starts with intelligence, integrity, and innovation ‚Äî the core values of MARS and everything we do at MARSAIL.

## MARS: A Quadtree-Driven Deep Learning Architecture for Precision Car Damage Segmentation

---

Central to the design of **MARS** (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes) lies a novel AI architecture designed to push the boundaries of **instance segmentation**‚Äîspecifically, for car damage detection. Traditional models like Mask R-CNN rely heavily on coarse ROI alignments and fixed spatial grids, which often result in poor mask quality for irregular or fine-grained structures like scratches, dents, or cracks. MARS overcomes this limitation through a unique **quadtree-based spatial hierarchy**, allowing the network to adaptively decompose images into finer patches only where needed, focusing computational attention on high-detail regions.

Technically, our method integrates a **Self-Attention Refinement Module (SARM)** with **Sequential Quadtree Node Encoding** to build hierarchical context from coarse-to-fine levels. Instead of treating spatial locations uniformly, we recursively subdivide image regions using quadtree decomposition, capturing fine structural features with higher resolution where necessary. Let $Q = \{q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n\}$ denote the set of quadtree nodes generated per instance mask. Each node $q_i$ is embedded and passed through a transformer encoder, which models long-range dependencies via multi-head self-attention:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QW_Q (QW_K)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)QW_V
$$

These representations are aggregated to recalibrate channel-wise features dynamically, enabling MARS to predict high-fidelity instance masks with pixel-level accuracy.

In practice, **MARS outperforms Mask R-CNN, PointRend, and Mask Transfiner by +1.3 to +2.3 maskAP** on a Thai car damage dataset‚Äîdemonstrating that our approach is not only theoretically elegant but also empirically superior. Our model operates on top of the **FPN backbone (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 variants)**, and benefits from a cascaded refinement pipeline that improves mask boundaries at every stage. The full details, ablation studies, and demo results are available in our [GitHub](https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/MARS).

## The Starting Line

---

As I stood at the starting point of the 2024 IRONMAN 70.3 Bangsaen in Thailand, surrounded by breathtaking coastal scenery, a wave of anticipation and apprehension washed over me. The challenge ahead was daunting, yet exhilarating.

---

## The Race Breakdown

---

The triathlon comprised three grueling segments:

- üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **1.9km (1.2-mile) swim** to kick off the journey.
- üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **90km (56-mile) bike ride** through scenic routes.
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **21.1km (13.1-mile) run** that pushed me to my absolute limits.

<div style="text-align: center;">

  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;">Figure 2: The first challenge: a 1.9 km open-water swim in the rough sea at Bangsaen Beach. The waves were fierce, the crowd was intense, and the physical toll was real. But in those moments, I felt alive. The sting of saltwater in my eyes, the struggle to find a rhythm, the jostling of other swimmers ‚Äî it was all part of the experience. And despite being kicked in the chest by another athlete and the panic of overcrowded waters, I kept pushing. 56 minutes might not seem fast, but to me, it was a victory. It was the first step toward my dream, and I made it count.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;">Figure 3: From swim to bike: the transition that felt like a breath of fresh air. As I climbed out of the water and rushed toward the bike, I was met by an unexpected surprise ‚Äî Thai celebrity Tao Somchai Khemglad! I was starstruck, honestly. But in that moment, everything seemed to fall into place. A moment of connection, a fleeting encounter with someone who‚Äôs made a name in Thai culture, and here I was, sharing the same course. It was one of those little joys that made the whole race feel even more special.</p>

**PS.** The year began with completing the [**IM70.3**](https://www.ironman.com/) and ended with crossing the finish line at the [**Laguna Triathlon in Phuket**](https://www.lagunaphukettri.com/), which included a 1.8K swim, a 55K bike ride, and a 12K run. Truly, it was a year defined by triathlons for me.

> As I reflect on this experience, I feel immense gratitude‚Äîfor the beauty of Phuket, the camaraderie of my fellow athletes, and the personal growth this race has inspired. The Laguna Phuket Triathlon is more than just an event; it‚Äôs a celebration of human spirit and perseverance.

To anyone considering a triathlon, my advice is simple: go for it. Embrace the challenge, trust your training, and don‚Äôt forget to enjoy the ride. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned athlete or a first-timer like me, the journey will leave you stronger, wiser, and more fulfilled.

When I crossed the finish line of **IRONMAN 70.3** in **7 hours and 51 minutes**, well below the **cut-off**, it was the culmination of months of **hard work**, sweat, and **self-doubt**. That moment, when I held my **finisher medal** and looked at my race number ‚Äî **201** ‚Äî I realized it wasn‚Äôt just a race I had completed; it was a **transformation**. Every mile of the **1.9 km swim**, each moment on the **90 km bike ride**, and the final **21.1 km run** were stepping stones toward the person I had become ‚Äî someone capable of achieving the **extraordinary**.

Attending the Global Young Scientists Summit (GYSS) 2025 was an eye-opening experience that I will never forget. It was an incredible opportunity to be part of a vibrant community of like-minded young researchers and brilliant minds from around the world. This event was not just a platform for sharing ideas; it became a place where I could discover new perspectives on my research, meet fascinating people, and learn from the best in the field.

## Presenting My Work to Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn

The highlight of the summit was, without a doubt, the moment I had the incredible honor of presenting my work to Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.

As a young scientist, I was deeply humbled to share my research titled *‚ÄúMeViT: A Medium-Resolution Vision Transformer for Semantic Segmentation on Landsat Satellite Imagery for Agriculture in Thailand‚Äù* with Her Royal Highness. My work focuses on addressing challenges in agricultural monitoring and resource management by leveraging cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence. Specifically, MeViT is designed for semantic segmentation of Landsat satellite imagery, targeting key economic crops in Thailand such as para rubber, corn, and pineapple. By enhancing Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a medium-resolution multi-branch architecture and incorporating mixed-scale convolutional feedforward networks (MixCFN), MeViT excels at extracting multi-scale local information critical for precise segmentation.

Her Royal Highness listened with great interest, her graciousness reflecting her profound commitment to nurturing the next generation of scientists. She expressed encouragement for the practical applications of such research in addressing challenges critical to Thailand‚Äôs agricultural and environmental sustainability. Her unwavering support for young researchers is a testament to her dedication to fostering innovation for the betterment of society.

## Learning from Icons in the Field

The summit was filled with groundbreaking talks, and one of the most memorable was the Plenary Lecture by the renowned Professor Adi Shamir. As a Turing Award Laureate and an expert in cryptography and artificial intelligence, his lecture was truly thought-provoking. The topic, *‚ÄúCan you recover a deep neural network from its answers?‚Äù*, delved into one of the most critical questions of our time‚Äîhow deep learning models, which are at the forefront of AI, can be understood and potentially reverse-engineered.

The lecture began with a discussion on the architecture of modern neural networks, emphasizing their complexity and overparameterization. Professor Shamir explored concepts like model inversion, adversarial attacks, and the limitations of current AI systems, while raising questions about privacy-preserving AI and ethical AI frameworks. His insights on adversarial robustness and explainable AI deeply resonated with my research interests, motivating me to reflect on these critical challenges.

## Engaging in Dialogues on the Ethics of AI

The summit wasn‚Äôt just about science and innovation‚Äîit also provided a platform to engage in crucial discussions about the ethical implications of technological advancements. One such discussion was the Panel Huddle titled *‚ÄúEthics of Scientific Research in the Age of AI‚Äù*, featuring prominent professors like Adi Shamir, Shafi Goldwasser, and Kalai.

The panel explored topics such as algorithmic bias, dual-use AI technologies, privacy-preserving AI, and the responsibilities of researchers in educating the public and policymakers. These discussions offered profound insights into the complexities of conducting ethical research in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, reminding me of the broader purpose of scientific innovation: to create a more equitable future.

## Expanding My Network and Building New Collaborations

Beyond the lectures and discussions, GYSS 2025 was also a chance to meet fellow researchers from all over the globe. I had the pleasure of connecting with inspiring individuals from diverse fields of study, creating friendships that will last a lifetime. The exchange of ideas with these brilliant young scientists has already sparked new collaborations and research ideas that I can‚Äôt wait to explore further.

## A Day I‚Äôll Never Forget

All in all, my experience at GYSS 2025 was beyond what I could have imagined. It was a perfect blend of research, networking, and fun. It gave me the chance to engage with some of the brightest minds in science, learn from Nobel Laureates and Turing Award winners, and discuss pressing issues in AI and ethics. It was an unforgettable experience, and I‚Äôm leaving with new ideas, fresh perspectives, and the motivation to continue pushing the boundaries of my own research.

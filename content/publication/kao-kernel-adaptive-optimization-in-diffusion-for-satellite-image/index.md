abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

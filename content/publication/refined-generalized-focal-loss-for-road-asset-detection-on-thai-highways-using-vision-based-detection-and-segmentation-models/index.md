abstract: This paper dives into the cutting-edge world of road asset detection on Thai highways, showcasing a novel approach that combines an upgraded YOLOv8 model with Generalized Focal Loss. Our focus is on identifying key road elements—like pavilions, pedestrian bridges, information and warning signs, and concrete guardrails—to boost road safety and infrastructure management. While deep learning methods have shown promise, traditional models often struggle with accuracy in tricky conditions, such as cluttered backgrounds and variable lighting. To tackle these issues, we've integrated YOLOv8 with Generalized Focal Loss, enhancing its ability to detect road assets with greater precision. Our results are impressive, the YOLOv8x model led the way with a mAP50 of 80.340, mAP50-95 of 60.840, precision of 79.100, recall of 76.680, and an F1-score of 77.870. These findings highlight the YOLOv8x model’s superior performance, demonstrating the power of advanced deep learning techniques to improve highway safety and infrastructure maintenance, even in challenging conditions.

### Exciting News: Oral Presentation at iCHE 2024!

I am thrilled to share that our paper titled **"Enhanced YOLOv8-Based Object Detection of Road Assets Utilizing Generalized Focal Loss: A Case Study on Thai Highway Imagery"** has been accepted for an oral presentation at the **5th International Conference on Highway Engineering (iCHE 2024)**! After a long absence from international conferences since my Ph.D. studies, I'm incredibly excited to rejoin the academic community in person and present our latest research.

> Dive into the complete details of our research on road asset detection in Thai highways with advanced vision models. Check out the full blog post here: [Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/blog/2024-09-07-refined-generalized-focal-loss-for-road-asset-detection-on-thai-highways-using-vision-models/)

Stay tuned for updates, and a big thank you to my incredible research team:  
**N. Rattanachona**, **P. Thungthin**, **N. Subsompon**, **S. Thongbai**, **W. Wongweeranimit**, and **R. Phukham**. I’m grateful for your hard work and dedication to this project!

#### Paper Highlights:
Our research tackles a critical challenge in road safety and infrastructure management: detecting essential road assets such as pedestrian bridges, pavilions, signs, and concrete guardrails. We introduce an enhanced YOLOv8 model integrated with **Generalized Focal Loss**, which significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in complex environments with varied lighting and backgrounds.

The results speak for themselves:
- **mAP50**: 80.340
- **mAP50-95**: 60.840
- **Precision**: 79.100
- **Recall**: 76.680
- **F1-Score**: 77.870

These metrics highlight the robustness and precision of our method, underscoring its potential to enhance road safety initiatives.

#### What’s Next?
In addition to being featured in the conference proceedings, our paper will go through a **fast-track formal review process** for potential publication in the **Transportmetrica A journal** (published by Taylor and Francis). We’re hopeful that this work will make a meaningful contribution to the field of highway engineering and road asset management.

I’m genuinely excited to share our findings at iCHE 2024 and connect with the incredible minds in the field. I hope our research sparks inspiration in others, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. It would be truly rewarding if our work motivates even one person to contribute to something extraordinary in the world. Research is not just about discovering new things—it's about igniting ideas, fostering collaboration, and collectively making a positive impact. Here’s to all the future breakthroughs, and may this be just the beginning of many more amazing contributions ahead!

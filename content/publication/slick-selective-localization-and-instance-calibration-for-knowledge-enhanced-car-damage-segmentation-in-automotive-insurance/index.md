abstract: We present SLICK, a novel framework for precise and robust car damage segmentation that leverages structural priors and domain knowledge to tackle real-world automotive inspection challenges. SLICK introduces five key components (1) Selective Part Segmentation using a high-resolution semantic backbone guided by structural priors to achieve surgical accuracy in segmenting vehicle parts even under occlusion, deformation, or paint loss; (2) Localization-Aware Attention blocks that dynamically focus on damaged regions, enhancing fine-grained damage detection in cluttered and complex street scenes; (3) an Instance-Sensitive Refinement head that leverages panoptic cues and shape priors to disentangle overlapping or adjacent parts, enabling precise boundary alignment; (4) Cross-Channel Calibration through multi-scale channel attention that amplifies subtle damage signals such as scratches and dents while suppressing noise like reflections and decals; and (5) a Knowledge Fusion Module that integrates synthetic crash data, part geometry, and real-world insurance datasets to improve generalization and handle rare cases effectively. Experiments on large-scale automotive datasets demonstrate SLICK's superior segmentation performance, robustness, and practical applicability for insurance and automotive inspection workflows.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose SLICK, a novel and efficient framework for high-precision car damage segmentation, designed for real-world deployment in automotive insurance and inspection workflows. SLICK introduces five synergistic components, selective part segmentation guided by structural priors, localization-aware attention to highlight fine-grained damage, instance-sensitive refinement for precise boundary separation, cross-channel calibration to amplify subtle cues like scratches and dents, and a knowledge fusion module that integrates synthetic crash data, part geometry, and annotated insurance datasets. Trained using a teacher–student distillation strategy with ALBERT as the teacher, SLICK retains high segmentation fidelity while achieving up to 7× faster inference. Extensive experiments on large-scale automotive datasets demonstrate SLICK’s superior accuracy, generalization, and runtime efficiency—making it ideal for real-time, high-stakes applications in insurance automation and vehicle inspection.
